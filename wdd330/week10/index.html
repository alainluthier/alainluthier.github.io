      <h3>Week 10-MDN: Validating forms</h3>  <br>
      <h4>
          Types of Validation
      </h4>
      <p>
        There are two types: 
        <ul>
            <li>Build-in form validation using HTML5: For example in a input tag we can use the words 
                <b>required, minlength, maxlength and pattern</b>
            </li>
            <li>JavaScritp: I'ts very customizable, we can use properties like <b>.validity.valid</b>
            and many other functions of JavaScritp.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
      </p>
      <h3>Week 10-MDN: Using fetch</h3>
      <h4>Using Fetch</h4>
      <p>
          Fetch provides an interface for accessing and manipulating parts of HTTP pipeline.
      </p>
      <p>
          Fetch could be used to send requests, upload JSON data, files and multiple files.
      </p>
      <p>
          There are functions to check if  a fetch was successful, there are: <b>then and catch error</b>
      </p>
      <h3>Questions:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Who is more fast AJAX or Fetch?
        </li>
        <li>
            Is there a validator in HTML5 to set that the input needs to be more than 0? I think that I can use min = 0 but it includes the zero value, I don't want to include the zero value only greater values.
        </li>
